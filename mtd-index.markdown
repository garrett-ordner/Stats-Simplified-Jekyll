This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks reviewing basic statistical analysis methods and practices and implementing them in Python.  I made these for my own use but they may be worth your time.  The sources for this material are a mix of class notes from my prior coursework and "Statistical Methods in the Life Sciences" by P.V. Rao.
