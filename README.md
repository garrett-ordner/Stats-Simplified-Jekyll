Stats-Simplified-Jekyll is the repo supporting [Stats Simplified](https://www.statssimplified.org), a free online course intended to serve both as a free online course in probability and statistical theory and as a freely available resource for educators seeking to teach the subject.  Associated .R codefiles will be provided along with basic lessons in R coding where necessary to supplement the course through visualization and simulation.

The course consists of short, 10-20 slide lessons which follow "Statistical Inference" (2nd Ed.) by George Casella and Roger L. Berger.  While ideally viewed as a PowerPoint slideshow, .pdf versions have been generated for embedding within the website.

The naming convention of lessons covering "Statistical Inference" is Presentation-(chapter)-(section)-(lesson number)-(lesson name).

The lesson_nav folder contains the same lessons featured in the lessons folder in a more easily navigable directory structure.
