StatsSimplified.org is an open-source educational project intended to serve as a free online course for those interested in learning about probability and statistics, as well as a freely available resource for educators looking to teach the subject. It aims to explain and illustrate probability and statistics through short lessons that follow along with "Statistical Inference" (2nd Ed.) by George Casella and Roger Berger.  It also aims to supplement the text through the use of R programming for purposes of simulation and visualization.

All lessons are available as an editable PowerPoint and are embedded within the site's posts as .pdf files.  The content is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and can be freely altered and redistributed.  All project assets are hosted in a GitHub repository located [here](https://github.com/garrett-ordner/Stats-Simplified-Jekyll).  The [lesson_nav folder](https://github.com/garrett-ordner/Stats-Simplified-Jekyll/tree/master/lesson_nav) also provides a more organized layout for finding lessons from specific sections of "Statistical Inference".

Lessons in theory and coding can be accessed in the header menu.

Thanks,

Garrett
