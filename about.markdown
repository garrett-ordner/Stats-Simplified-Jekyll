Hi!  Welcome to StatsSimplified.org, a free online course that aims to explain and illustrate probability and statistics through short lessons that follow along with "Statistical Inference" (2nd Ed.) by George Casella and Roger Berger.

This course is hosted on a GitHub Pages site powered by Jekyll.  It's currently under construction, but for now, you can find a full index of all available courses by clicking "Lesson Index" in the navigation menu.

The GitHub repository hosting this site's assets and all available lessons can be found at ##repo name##, where the "lesson_nav" folder also provides a more organized layout for finding lessons from specific sections of "Statistical Inference".
