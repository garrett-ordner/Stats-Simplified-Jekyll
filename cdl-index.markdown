Here's where you'll find the coding lessons.  Each CDL (CoDing-Lesson) corresponds to the chapter and section of "Statistical Inference" that matches the theory lesson it's intended to supplement.  Lessons that aren't intended to supplement a theory lesson will have a chapter number of 0.

You can click on the categories in the table to auto-scroll to the corresponding section.
