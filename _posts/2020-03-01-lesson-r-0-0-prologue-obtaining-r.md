Pretty soon we're gonna need to write some code.  Luckily, I'm here to teach you how to do it!  We're gonna start by installing R and RStudio.  Then, we'll get to write some code. The Powerpoint version of this presentation can be downloaded here: [Presentation R-0-1:  Prologue:  Obtaining R](/lessons/Presentation-R-0-1-Prologue-Obtaining-R.pptx)
