Now we&#8217;re getting to the good stuff!  We&#8217;re not only taking a deeper dive into the axioms of probability, we&#8217;re also proving that a (relatively) simple function satisfies all three of the axioms and gives us an easier way to define probability.  I know some of this looks a little intimidating, but there are plenty of annotations to guide you through the math.  Plus, it&#8217;s fun!
