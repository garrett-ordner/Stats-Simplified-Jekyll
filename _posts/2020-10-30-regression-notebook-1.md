This is the first notebook covering regression topics.  It starts with basic estimation and diagnostics.  It's possible I may delve into matrix algebra in a later post.

The sample data I'm using for this is 3_1_Generator_Y2019.xlsx from form EIA-860, available [here](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/).  The data contains generator-level data reported by utilities to the Energy Information Administration for calendar year 2019.
